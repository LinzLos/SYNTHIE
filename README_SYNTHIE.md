# 🧠 SYNTHIE v1.2

**SYNTHIE** is a structured, LLM-native script designed to support **researchers, strategists, and insight teams** working with transcripts, quotes, or field data.  
It works seamlessly inside tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or even your internal apps.

It acts as a reusable *thinking skeleton* for analysis — guiding you through quote tagging, research question mapping, workflow synthesis, and theme clustering. Whether you're solo-sifting through interview data or collaborating with PMs and designers, SYNTHIE helps you move from messy input to structured, stakeholder-ready insight — without writing a new prompt every time.

## 🚀 How to Use SYNTHIE

You have three easy options:

1. **Upload the `.txt` or `.xml` file** to your LLM  
   Then say:  
   `Use this SYNTHIE script to analyze my interview transcripts.`

2. **Use a slash command (if supported):**  
   `/run_synthie "Use this SYNTHIE script to help me tag and cluster user quotes..."`

3. **Copy-paste the SYNTHIE content between `<instructions>` tags** into your LLM.  
   This works great if file upload isn’t available. The script will prompt you to enter missing details or pick a task to start with.
